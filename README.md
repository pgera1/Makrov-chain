Markov Chain Text Generator

This project implements a lightweight Markov chain–based text generation system in Python. It analyzes a training text file and builds a probabilistic model that predicts the next character based on the previous n characters (Markov order). Higher orders lead to more coherent text, while lower orders generate more random sequences. The project is designed to be simple, instructional, and easy to run inside Google Colab.

Features

Upload any .txt file as training data
Choose Markov chain order (1–10)
Character-level Markov modeling
Generates customizable text length
Runs fully in Google Colab (no installation required)

How to Use

Open the Colab notebook (link below).
Run the notebook cells.
Upload your training text when prompted.
Enter the Markov order when asked (higher = more accurate text).
Generated text will appear in the output section.
